# Temp Drive

Temp Drive is a simple solution to a common problem, sharing files between devices. It acts as a **temporary network storage** that securely hosts your files via a time sensitive passphrase. Files and data are unavailable after the expired time and completely deleted after 24 hours to protect your information (and save money on data storage).

One of the main goals when creating Temp Drive was to **avoid annoying logins**. It accomplishes this by assigning each files a unique "passphrase" consisting of 5 randomly selected words.

The entire project is open source and it is highly encouraged for people to [contribute](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), raise [issues](https://github.com/CurtisHughes/temp-drive/issues), and have [discussions](https://github.com/CurtisHughes/temp-drive/discussions).

Don't trust us with your data? [Host your own solution](./docs/HOSTING.md)! We will only be slightly insulted.
